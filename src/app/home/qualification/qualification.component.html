          <b> Purpose of the study:</b> You are being asked to participate in a research study that is being done by
          Mirta
          Galesic and Henrik Olsson from the Santa Fe Institute, funded by the NSF. The purpose of this study is to
          investigate parents’ beliefs about different issues, including vaccination and GM food. You are being asked
          to take part in this study because you are living in the US and are at least 18 years old.
        </p>

        <p>This form will explain what to expect when joining the research, as well as the possible risks and benefits
          of participation. If you have any questions, please ask one of the study researchers.</p>

        <p><b>What you will do in the study:</b> Your participation will involve answering questions about yourself
          and your
          opinions, such as “Is growing GM crops is harmful or beneficial to the environment?”, “Are childhood
          vaccines natural or unnatural?”, and “Do you have children under 18 years of age at home?”. You might be
          asked to participate in up to three survey waves, each two weeks apart. A survey wave should take no more
          than 10 minutes. You will also be asked to invite two of your friends, whose opinions are important to you
          when thinking about parenting, to complete a short questionnaire.</p>

        <p> <b>Risks:</b> There are no known risks in this research, but some individuals may experience discomfort or
          loss
          of privacy when answering questions.</p>

        <p><b>Benefits:</b> The findings from this project will provide information on belief formation and social
          influence.
          Confidentiality of your information: There are no names or identifying information associated with your
          responses. Data will be kept securely and not shared with anyone else. Your personal information will only
          be used for compensation and will not be connected to your answers.</p>

        <p><b>Payment:</b> You will receive $5 for each survey wave you participate in and $10 for each friend that
          completes
          the study.</p>

        <p> <b>Right to withdraw from the study:</b> Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You
          have the right
          to choose not to participate or to withdraw your participation at any point in this study without penalty.
        </p>

        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about the research, please feel free to call Mirta
          Galesic
          or Henrik Olsson at (505) 946-2703 or email at support@mysurveys.santafe.edu. If you have questions
          regarding
          your rights as a research participant, or about what you should do in case of any harm to you, or if you
          want
          to obtain information or offer input, please contact the UNM Office of the IRB (OIRB) at (505) 277-2644 or

            Scientists have added genes to certain food crops to make them
            insect resistant and herbicide tolerant. These are called
            genetically modified (GM) crops. Examples of GM crops in the U.S.
            include some corn, soybeans, and canola. The next question is about
            GM food made from these crops.

            A vaccine imitates an infection without inducing the disease, and
            leads the immune system to develop immunity to that disease. The
            next question is about vaccines currently recommended for children
            (childhood vaccines), such as the Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
            vaccine or the Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine.
